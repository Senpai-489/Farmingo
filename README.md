# Supacode - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024

## Team Details
- **Team Name:** Supacode
- **Team Leader:** Krishna Goswami
- **Problem Statement:** Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making

## Project Overview
This project implements a web-based application designed to empower farmers by providing them with insights about water availability, soil moisture, crop health, and other critical agricultural insights. It integrates satellite datasets, machine learning models, and visualization tools to make data actionable, helping farmers optimize their crop management strategies.

## Key Features
- **Water Demand Analysis:** Using Prophet and other models to predict water demand and scenarios like droughts or floods.
- **Intelligent Irrigation Scheduling:** Optimize water usage with real-time data on weather, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration.
- **Crop Disease Prediction:** Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict crop diseases.
- **Pesticide Suggestions:** Provide recommendations for effective pesticide use based on crop and soil conditions.
- **Yield Analysis:** Historical data tracking to help farmers maximize their yield and improve profits.
- **AI Chatbot:** A user-friendly chatbot to assist farmers with queries related to agriculture.
- **Drought and Flood Risk Monitoring:** Using NASAâ€™s GRACE data to predict groundwater levels and potential flood or drought risks.

  ## Updates
- **JWT Authentication:** User Authentication implemented using JWT.
- **Frontend UI DashBoard:** Frontend UI implemented using React and Tailwind CSS
- **Features Implemented on Day 1:**
- Crop Disease Prediction
- Pesticide Suggestion
- Crop Water Analysis
- Profile Setup
- News and Schemes Page
- AI chatbot

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Models:**
